# Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Discovering Facts from Knowledge Graph Embeddings

### Abstract
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are being used in many real-world application domains, ranging from search engines to biomedical data analysis. Even if there is a large corpus of KGs available, they are inherently incomplete due to the incompleteness of the sources based on which they were constructed. Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) is a very popular technique to complete KGs. However, they are only capable of answering true or false to a given fact. Thus, users need to provide a concrete query or some test data. Unfortunately, such queries or data are not always available.  There are cases where one wants to discover all (or as many as possible) missing facts from an input KG given a KGE model.  To do so, one should provide to the KGE model candidate facts consisting of the complement of the input KG.  This can be infeasible even for small graphs simply due to the size of the complement graph. In this paper, we define the problem of discovering missing facts from a given KGE model and refer to it as {\em fact discovery}. We study sampling methods to get candidate facts and then using KGEs to retrieve the most plausible ones. We extensively evaluate different existing sampling methods and provide guidelines on when each one of them is most suitable. We also discuss the challenges and limitations that we encountered when investigating the different techniques. With these insights, we hope to shed light and attract more researchers to work on this unexplored direction.

This repository provides code to replicate the experiments conducted in the research paper Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Discovering Facts from Knowledge Graph Embeddings.
